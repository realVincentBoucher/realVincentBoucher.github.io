VIP AI 101 CheatSheet for Allhttp://www.montreal.ai/ai4all.pdf A Legendary History Learn the Source of an Exceptional LegacyBorn in July 1973 in Québec City, Québec, Canada. A frail kid raised by youth centers and social welfare families (Sept. 8, 1981 – June 21, 1991) (photo before), Vincent Boucher has done his first grade twice as well as his seventh grade. Until age 14, he faced a nightmare. In May 1988, he found in a recycling bin a book quoting William James. At this moment, he decided to change his life. «To change one’s life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly. No exceptions.». – William James In 1993, Vincent Boucher took only 29 minutes to win, with the first 100 % score ever, the Ordre des chimiste du Québec competition. In 1996, he completed a B. Sc. Theoretical Physics in 1 year (suite de l’article), followed by a Master’s degree in Government Policy Analysis (1998) and a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering (2000). From 2000 to 2002, he provided management consulting for the Canadian Space Agency.
